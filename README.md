# Unary to ASCII converter
The rule is simple: If 0 = 1 and 00 = 0 how can we convert a value like 0 0 00 000 0 00 to ASCII?

This code do this job. :-)

## What is Unary?
According Wikipedia "In mathematics, a unary operation is an operation with only one operand, i.e. a single input.This is in contrast to binary operations, which use two operands. 

An example is the function f : A â†’ A, where A is a set. 
The function f is a unary operation on A."

In our case we will get the pairs of values where the 1st element is the value and the 2nd is how many times the value will be showed.
